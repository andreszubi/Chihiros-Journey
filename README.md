## Chihiro's Journey

## Description
Chihiros' Journey is a game based of the animated film called "Spirited Away.
In this game, your objective is to get accross the bridge safely without colliding
into any of the spirits along your way, or else you will lose the game. You will also have to eat the food that comes along the way so that your character remains invisible to the spirits, which you will have a timer on your screen to keep track of, or else if your invisibility ends you will lose the game. There is also food which takes time away from your winning time which allows you to safely cross the bridge. Once the winning timer runs out , you win the game and you helped Chihiro get back home safely with her parents.

## MVP

Chihiro needs to move around to avoid the spirits and to eat the foods heading her way.

Two different types of spirits will be heading towards the player's way.

If you collide with any of them, then you lose.
